# blog

This is a mini blogging app. At the top, write about any topic that interest you.

The intent of the blog is to further familiarize myself with the pre-build ORM sequelize. 
I also used express to create the server, sql database to store the data, handlebars
as a templating engine, Jquery, ajax, and bootstrap.

Further enhancements to this application: 
User authentication
Relationships in database
Separate pages to view & edit blogs
